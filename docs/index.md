### OpenTK

> [!Warning]
> This reference documentation is for OpenTK 3.x **ONLY**. Please visit the official [OpentTK](https://opentk.net/) website for the most up-to-date information about everything OpenTK.

The Open Toolkit is a set of fast, portable, low-level C# bindings for OpenGL, OpenGL ES, OpenAL, and OpenCL.  It runs on all major platforms and powers hundreds of apps, games, and scientific research programs.

OpenTK provides several utility libraries, including a math/linear algebra package, a windowing system, and input handling.

OpenTK is not a game engine, nor does it try to be one:  It offers a useful set of tools and lets you decide how to use them.  It is the ideal starting point if you want to write a game or scientific application from the ground up.
